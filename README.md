# NewsAppStage1
News app, Stage 1. Project from course ABND by Google in Udacity.

The goal is to create a News Feed app which gives a user regularly-updated news from the internet related to a particular topic, person, or location. The presentation of the information as well as the topic is up to you.

This project is about combining various ideas and skills weâ€™ve been practicing throughout the course. They include:

- Connecting to an API
- Parsing the JSON response
- Handling error cases gracefully
- Updating information regularly
- Using an AsyncTask
- Doing network operations independent of the Activity lifecycle

Note: As the focus of this program is Java, only projects completed with Java as the source code will be accepted. Projects using Kotlin as the source code will not be accepted.
